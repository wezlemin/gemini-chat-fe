# gemini-chat-fe
A front-end interface for Gemini Chat that communicates directly with the Gemini API. This allows users to interact with the model through a custom client using the following endpoint:

```https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025:generateContent?key=${apiKey}```

## Notes: 
This could be used to bypass blocks done by schools on common AIs, like:
- https://chatgpt.com/
- https://gemini.google.com/
- https://copilot.microsoft.com/
- https://claude.ai/
- https://www.perplexity.ai/
- https://grok.com/
- https://www.deepseek.com/
- https://you.com/

As long as the API endpoint is not blocked.


### The AI does not remember previous messages. This interface is limited in what it can show.
